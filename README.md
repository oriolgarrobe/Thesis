# Abstract

Electronics engineers rely on component tolerances to create functional designs. It is important to be aware that each component brings some uncertainty to the functionality of the assembly and therefore to the performance. To deal with this problem there are different approaches within the tolerance analysis field. Currently Veoneer uses the Worst Case Circuit Analysis methodology that assumes that the worst scenario for every component is possible, achieving very safe but pessimistic results. Electronics design can therefore be optimized through statistical analysis.

This work focuses on modelling the variance in the performance of a set of electronic components that compose a device or assembly by means of statistical techniques. It uses different methodologies to find models to explain the behaviour of these assemblies and it tests its results through different statistical tests to decide which one performs the best. From this point the work is focused upon finding the tolerance limits that are optimal for the design while fulfilling safety requirements imposed by the automotive regulatory body. The result obtained substantially improves the previousWorst Case Circuit Analysis model while being as safe as required. This is a methodology that does not require of huge amounts of data; making the process affordable for industry. Finally, it can be concluded that statistical tolerance analysis can improve substantially the current results and boost the design of safety elements in electronics in the automotive industry while being as reliable as always.
